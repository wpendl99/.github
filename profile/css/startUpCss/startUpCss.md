# Start up deliverable - CSS

Now that you have learned the basics of CSS, is time to style your startup application. The application doesn't have to do anything, but it should appear basically like what you expect your final application to look like. In the next deliverable you will add JavaScript to make your application functional.

You must use the same start up GitHub repository that you created for the previous deliverable. Update the README.md file with things that you learn as you work on your start up. As you make changes to your CSS commit those changes and push them to GitHub. You will need at least four commits to get full credit, but in reality you should have many more than that.

Remember to use the `Live Server VS Code extension` to see what your code looks like in the browser. Also use the browser's debugger window to debug your CSS.

Once you have developed your application to where you want it, you need to release it to your production environment. **Copy** the `deployFiles.sh` script from the [Simon CSS repository](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-css/blob/main/deployFiles.sh) to your start up repository and use `startup` for the service parameter (`-s`)

```sh
./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup
```

For example,

```sh
./deployFiles.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s startup
```

Doing this will make this deliverable of your start up available from `https://startup.yourdomainname`.

### Update your website's home page

You should also update your website's home page with a link to your project so that you can access everything you have done for this class from the home page. This will make a great portfolio of all your work in this class. You can easily do this by modifying the index.html file that is part of the website-html repository that you created in the earlier instruction and deploying it using the script found in that repository. Make sure you run this script from a console where your working directory is the website-html repository and not your start up repository.

```sh
./deployWebsite.sh  -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain>
```
