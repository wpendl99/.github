# CSS Grid

The `grid` display layout is useful when you want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid. We start with a container element that has a bunch of child elements.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
</div>
```

We turn this into a responsive grid by including a CSS `display` property with the value of `grid` on the container element. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a grid flow. The next property, `grid-template-columns`, specifies that the layout of the grid columns. In this example we say that we want to repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent element's width with children that are resized to a minimum of 300 pixels and a maximum of one equal fractional unit (`1fr`) of the grid width. A fractional unit is dynamically computed by splitting up the parent element's width into equal parts for each of the children.

We finish off the grid configuration by saying that we want all rows to be exactly 300 pixels high with the `grid-auto-rows` property and the use the `grid-gap` property to say that we want at least a 1 em gap between our grid items.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```

Here is what the finished product looks like.
