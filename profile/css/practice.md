# CSS Practice

Now that you know how to create CSS rules using selectors to apply declarations to HTML elements, it's time to experiment and see what you can come up with. Create a CodePen that uses multiple CSS rules to style an HTML page. Include some sort of simple animation.

If you are looking for inspiration then here is one of my [favorite animations](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/gOXZwEZ), this [animated burger menu](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/bGKxVEv) is pretty incredible, and here is a [home page](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/jOKvbrv) that is pure HTML and CSS. Don't feel like you need to build anything this complex but try and take things a little beyond your current abilities.

## ☑ Assignment

When you are done upload the URL of your CodePen with a description of what you found interesting to the Canvas assignment.

Don't forget to update your GitHub startup repository README.md with all of the things you learned and want to remember.
