# CSS Fonts

**Suggested reading**: [MDN Web fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts)

Choosing appropriate fonts is a key web application design characteristic. A beautiful modern font will make your application enjoyable to use. Picking a hard to read font, an overused font, or using too many fonts will turn users away.

The CSS `font-family` property defines what fonts should be used. The property value represents an ordered list of fonts. The first font in the list that is available will be used. This ability to select from a list of fonts is important because different operating systems have different default fonts and your first choice may not be available.

## Font families

There are four major families of fonts: `Serif`, `san-serif`, `fixed`, and `symbol`. A serif is a small stroke attached to the ends of the major strokes of a character. Serif fonts have the extra strokes, san-serif fonts do not. Fixed fonts characters all are the same width. This is useful for lining up text when doing things like coding or display tabular data. Symbol fonts represent non-language characters such as arrows or emojis.

## Importing fonts

In addition to referencing standard fonts found on the user's computer you can specify a font that you include in the files provided by your application. That way your application is guaranteed to always look the same. In order to have the browser load a font you use the `@font-face` rule and provide the font name and source location.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.woff2');
}

p {
  font-family: Quicksand;
}
```

If you do not want to host font files from your server, then you can load them from a font provider. For example, Google provides a large selection of [open source fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) that you can use without paying any royalties. The easiest way to use Google fonts is to use a CSS import statement to reference the Google Font Service. This will automatically generate CSS for importing the font.

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap');

p {
  font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
}
```
