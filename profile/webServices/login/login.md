# Account creation and login

The first step towards supporting authentication in your web application is providing the user a way to uniquely identify themselves. This usually requires two service endpoints. One to initially `create` an authentication credential, and a second to authenticate, or `login`, on future visits. Additionally, web services often have a `getMe` endpoint that gives information about the currently authenticated user. We will implement this endpoint to demonstrate that authentication is actually working correctly.

## Endpoint design

Using HTTP we can map out the design of our each of our endpoints.

### Create authentication endpoint

This takes an email and password and returns a cookie containing the authentication token and user ID. If the email already exists it returns a 409 (conflict) status code.

```http
POST /auth/create HTTP/2
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email":"marta@id.com",
  "password":"toomanysecrets"
}
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Set-Cookie: auth=tokenHere

{
  "id":"337"
}
```

### Login authentication endpoint

This takes an email and password and returns a cookie containing the authentication token and user ID. If the email does not exist or the password is bad it returns a 401 (unauthorized) status code.

```http
POST /auth/login HTTP/2
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email":"marta@id.com",
  "password":"toomanysecrets"
}
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Set-Cookie: auth=tokenHere

{
  "id":"337"
}

```

### GetMe endpoint

This uses the authentication token stored in the cookie to look up and return information about the authenticated user. If the token or user do not exist it returns a 401 (unauthorized) status code.

```http
GET /user/me HTTP/2
Cookie: auth=tokenHere
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email":"marta@id.com"
}

```

## Web service

With our service endpoints designed, we can now build our web service using Express.

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/auth/create', async (req, res) => {
  res.send({ id: 'user@id.com' });
});

app.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
  res.send({ id: 'user@id.com' });
});

const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Follow along by doing these steps.

1. Create a directory called `authTest`
1. Save the above content to a file named `main.js`
1. Run `npm init -y`
1. Run `npm install express cookie-parser mongodb uuid bcrypt`
1. Run `node main.js` or press `F5` in VS Code.
1. You can now open a console window and use curl to try out one of the endpoints.

   ```sh
   ➜  curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/create

   {"id":"user@id.com"}
   ```

## Handling requests

With our basic service created, we can now implement the create authentication endpoint. The first step is to read the credentials from the body of the HTTP request. Since the body is designed to contain JSON we need to tell Express that it should parse HTTP requests with a content type of `application/json` automatically into a JavaScript object. We do this by using the `express.json` middleware. We can then read the email and password directly out of the `req.body` object. We can test that this is working by temporarily including them in the response.

```js
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/auth/create', (req, res) => {
  res.send({
    id: 'user@id.com',
    email: req.body.email,
    password: req.body.password,
  });
});
```

```sh
➜  curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/create -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"email":"marta@id.com", "password":"toomanysecrets"}'

{"id":"user@id.com","email":"marta@id.com","password":"toomanysecrets"}
```

Now that we have proven that we can parse the request bodies correctly, we can change the code to add a check to see if we already have a user with that email address. If we do then we immediately return a 409 (conflict) status code. Otherwise we create a new user and return the user ID.

```js
app.post('/auth/create', async (req, res) => {
  if (await getUser(req.body.email)) {
    res.status(409).send({ msg: 'Existing user' });
  } else {
    const user = await createUser(req.body.email, req.body.password);
    res.send({
      id: user._id,
    });
  }
});
```

## Using the database

We want to persistently store our users in Mongo and so we need to set up our code to connect to and use the database. This is all covered in the instruction on data services if you want to review what it is doing.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

const userName = process.env.MONGOUSER;
const password = process.env.MONGOPASSWORD;
const hostname = process.env.MONGOHOSTNAME;

const url = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@${hostname}`;
const client = new MongoClient(url);
const collection = client.db('authTest').collection('user');
```

With a Mongo collection object we can implement the `getUser` and `createUser` functions.

```js
function getUser(email) {
  return collection.findOne({ email: email });
}

async function createUser(email, password) {
  const user = {
    email: email,
    password: password,
    token: 'xxx',
  };
  return collection.insertOne(user);
}
```

But, we are missing a couple of things. We need to a real authentication token, and we cannot simply store a password in our database.

## Generating authentication tokens

To generate a reasonable authentication token we use the `uuid` package. [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) stands for Universally Unique Identifier, and it does a really good job creating a hard to guess, random, unique ID.

```js
const uuid = require('uuid');

token: uuid.v4();
```

## Securing passwords

Next we need to not store our passwords. Doing so is a major security concern. If, and it has happened to many major organizations and companies, a hacker is able to access the database, they will have the passwords for all of your users. This may not seem like a big deal if your application is not very valuable, but users often reuse passwords. That means you will also provide the hacker with the means to attack the user on many other websites.

So instead of storing the password directly, we want to cryptographically hash the password so that we never store the actual password. When we want to validate a password during login, we can hash the login password and compare it to our stored hash of the password.

To hash our passwords we will use the `bcrypt` package. This creates a very secure one way hash of the password. If you are interested in understanding how [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) works, it is definitely worth the time.

```js
async function createUser(email, password) {
  // Hash the password before we insert it into the database
  const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

  const user = {
    email: email,
    password: passwordHash,
    token: uuid.v4(),
  };
  await collection.insertOne(user);

  return user;
}
```

## Passing authentication tokens

We now need to pass our generated authentication token to the browser when the login endpoint is called, and get it back on subsequent requests. To do this we use HTTP cookies. The `cookie-parser` package provides middleware for cookies and so we will leverage that.

We import the `cookieParser` object and then tell our app to use it. When a user is successfully created, or logs in, we set the cookie header. Since we are storing an authentication token in the cookie we want to make it as secure as possible, and so we use the httpOnly, secure, and sameSite options.

- `httpOnly` tells the browser to not allow JavaScript running on the browser to read the cookie.
- `secure` requires HTTPS to be used when sending the cookie back to the server.
- `sameSite` will only return the cookie to the domain that generated it.

```js
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

// Use the cookie parser middleware
app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/auth/create', async (req, res) => {
  if (await getUser(req.body.email)) {
    res.status(409).send({ msg: 'Existing user' });
  } else {
    const user = await createUser(req.body.email, req.body.password);

    // Set the cookie
    setAuthCookie(res, user.token);

    res.send({
      id: user._id,
    });
  }
});

function setAuthCookie(res, authToken) {
  res.cookie('token', authToken, {
    secure: true,
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: 'strict',
  });
}
```

## Login endpoint

The login authorization endpoint needs to get the hashed password from the database, compare it to the provided password using `bcrypt.compare`, and if successful set the authentication token in the cookie. If the password does not match or there is no user with the given email the endpoint returns status 401 (unauthorized).

```js
app.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUser(req.body.email);
  if (user) {
    if (await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password)) {
      setAuthCookie(res, user.token);
      res.send({ id: user._id });
      return;
    }
  }
  res.status(401).send({ msg: 'Unauthorized' });
});
```

## GetMe endpoint

With everything in place to create credentials and login using the credentials, we can now implement the `getMe` endpoint to demonstrate that it all actually works. To implement this get get the user object from the database by querying on the authentication token. If there is not authentication token or there is no user with that token we return status 401 (unauthorized).

```js
app.get('/user/me', async (req, res) => {
  authToken = req.cookies['token'];
  const user = await collection.findOne({ token: authToken });
  if (user) {
    res.send({ email: user.email });
    return;
  }
  res.status(401).send({ msg: 'Unauthorized' });
});
```

## Final code

Here is the full example code.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const uuid = require('uuid');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const userName = process.env.MONGOUSER;
const password = process.env.MONGOPASSWORD;
const hostname = process.env.MONGOHOSTNAME;

const url = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@${hostname}`;
const client = new MongoClient(url);
const collection = client.db('authTest').collection('user');

app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.json());

// createAuthorization from the given credentials
app.post('/auth/create', async (req, res) => {
  if (await getUser(req.body.email)) {
    res.status(409).send({ msg: 'Existing user' });
  } else {
    const user = await createUser(req.body.email, req.body.password);
    setAuthCookie(res, user.token);
    res.send({
      id: user._id,
    });
  }
});

// loginAuthorization from the given credentials
app.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUser(req.body.email);
  if (user) {
    if (await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password)) {
      setAuthCookie(res, user.token);
      res.send({ id: user._id });
      return;
    }
  }
  res.status(401).send({ msg: 'Unauthorized' });
});

// getMe for the currently authenticated user
app.get('/user/me', async (req, res) => {
  authToken = req.cookies['token'];
  const user = await collection.findOne({ token: authToken });
  if (user) {
    res.send({ email: user.email });
    return;
  }
  res.status(401).send({ msg: 'Unauthorized' });
});

function getUser(email) {
  return collection.findOne({ email: email });
}

async function createUser(email, password) {
  const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  const user = {
    email: email,
    password: passwordHash,
    token: uuid.v4(),
  };
  await collection.insertOne(user);

  return user;
}

function setAuthCookie(res, authToken) {
  res.cookie('token', authToken, {
    secure: true,
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: 'strict',
  });
}

const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Testing it out

With everything implemented we can use curl to try everything out. First start up the web service from VS Code by pressing `F5` and selecting `node.js` as the debugger if you have not already done that. You can set break points on all of the different endpoints to see what they do and inspect the different variables. Then open a console window and run the following curl commands. You should see similar results. Note that the `-c` and `-b` parameters tell curl to store and use cookies with the given file.

```sh
➜  curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/create -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"email":"지안@id.com", "password":"toomanysecrets"}'

{"id":"639bb9d644416bf7278dde44"}


➜  curl -c cookie.txt -X POST localhost:8080/auth/login -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"email":"지안@id.com", "password":"toomanysecrets"}'

{"id":"639bb9d644416bf7278dde44"}


➜  curl -b cookie.txt localhost:8080/user/me

{"email":"지안@id.com"}
```
