# Authorization services

If your application is going to remember a user's data then it will need a way to uniquely associate the data with a particular credential. That usually means that you `authenticate` a user by asking for information, such as an email address and password. You then remember, for some period of time, that the user has authenticated by storing an `authentication token` on the user's device. Often that token is stored in a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie) that is passed back to your web service on each request. The service can now associate data that the user supplies with a unique identifier that corresponds to their authorization token.

Determining what a user is `authorized` to do in your application is also important. For example, you might have different roles in your application such as Administrators, Editors, and Customers. Once you have the ability to authenticate a user and store information about that user, you can also store the authorization for the user. A simple application might have a single field that represents the role of the user. The service code would then use that role to allow, limit, or prevent what a service endpoint does. A complex web application will usually have very powerful authorization representation that controls the user's access to every part of the application. For example, an Editor role might have authorization only to work on content that they created or were invited to.

As you might imagine, authentication and authorization can become very complex, very quickly. It is also a primary target for a hacker. If they can bypass the authentication or escalate what they are authorized to do then they can gain control of your application. Additionally, constantly forcing users to authenticate in a secure way causes users to not want to use an application. This creates opposing priorities. Keep the system secure or make it easy to use.

In an attempt to remove the complexity of authentication and authorization from your application many service providers and package developers have created solutions that you can use. Assuming that you are using a trusted, well tested, service this is an attractive option because it removes the cost of building, testing, and managing that critical infrastructure yourself.

Authorization services often use standard protocols for authenticating and authorizing. These include standards such as [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth), [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language), and [OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID). Additionally, they usually support concepts like `Single Sign On` (SSO) and Federated Login. Single sign on allows a user to use the same credentials for multiple web applications. For example, you can login into GitHub using your Google credentials. Federated login allows a user to login once and then the authentication token reused to automatically log the user into multiple websites. For example, logging into Gmail allows you to also use Google Docs and YouTube without logging in again.

For this course we will implement our own authentication using a simple a simple email/password design. Knowing how to implement a simple authentication design will help you appreciate what authentication services provide. If you want to experiment with different authorization services you might consider [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), or [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).
