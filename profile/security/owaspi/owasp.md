📖 Suggested reading: [OWASP 2021](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit research entity that manages the _Top Ten_ list of the most important web application security risks. Understanding, and periodically reviewing, this list will help to keep your web applications secure.

The following is a discussion of each of the entries in the top ten list, along with examples, and suggested mitigations.

## A01 Broken Access Control

📖 Suggested reading: [snyk Learn broken access control](https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/broken-access-control/javascript/)

Broken access control occurs when the application doesn't properly enforce permissions on users. This could mean that a non-admin user can do things that only an admin should be able to do, or admin accounts are improperly secured. While browser application code can restrict access by disabling UI for navigating to sensitive functionality, the ultimate responsibility for enforcing access control rests upon the application service.

As an example of broken access control, consider an application where the UI only provides a navigation to the administrator application settings if the user is an administrator. However, the attacker can simply change the URL to point to the application settings URL and gain access. Additionally, unless the service endpoints reject requests to obtain, and update, the application settings, any restrictions that the UI provides are meaningless.

Mitigations include:

- Strict access enforcement at the service level
- Clearly defined roles and elevation paths

## A02 Cryptographic Failures

Cryptographic failures occur when sensitive data is accessible either without encryption, with weak encryption protocols, or when cryptographic protections are ignored.

Sending any unencrypted data over a public network connection allows an attacker to capture the data. Even private, internal, network connections, or data that is store without encryption, is susceptibly to exploitation once an attacker gains access to the internal system.

Examples of ineffective cryptographic methods include hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 that are trivial to crack with modern hardware and tools.

Another cryptographic failure happens when applications do not validate the provided web certificate when establishing a network connection. This is a case of falsely assuming that if the protocol is secure then the entity represented by the protocol is acceptable.

Mitigations include:

- Use strong encryption for all data. This includes external, internal, in transit, and at rest data.
- Updating encryption algorithms as older algorithms become compromised.
- Properly using cryptographic safeguards.

## A03 Injection

📖 **Suggested reading**: [Snyk Learn SQL injection](https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/sql-injection/javascript/)

Injection exploits occur when an attacker is allowed to supply data that is then injected into a context where it violates the expected use of the user input. For example, consider an input field that is only expected to contain a user's password. Instead the attacker supplies a SQL database command in the password input.

**Supplied password**

```js
`p@ssword!'; DROP TABLE db; --`;
```

The application then uses a template SQL query to validate the user's password.

**Template query**

```js
`SELECT user FROM db WHERE password='${password}' LIMIT 1`;
```

When the supplied input is injected into the template an unintended query results. Notice that this query will delete the entire database table.

**Resulting query**

```sql
SELECT user FROM db WHERE password='p@ssword!'; DROP TABLE db; -- ` LIMIT 1
```

Mitigations include:

- Sanitizing input
- Use database prepared statements
- Restricting execution rights
- Limit output

## A04 Insecure Design

📖 **Suggested reading**: [Snyk Learn insecure design](https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/insecure-design/javascript/)

Insecure design broadly refers to architectural flaws that are unique for individual systems, rather than implementation errors. This happens when the application team doesn't focus on security when designing a system, or doesn't continuously reevaluate the application's security.

Insecure design exploits are based upon unexpected uses of the business logic that controls the functionality of the application. For example, if the application allows for trial accounts to be easily created, then an attacker could create a denial of service attack by creating millions of accounts and utilizing the maximum allowable usage.

Mitigations include:

- Integration testing
- Strict access control
- Security education
- Security design pattern usages
- Scenario reviews

## A05 Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfiguration attacks exploit the configuration of an application. Some examples include using default passwords, not updating software, exposing configuration settings, or enabling unsecured remote configuration.

For example, some third party utilities, such as a logging system, will expose a public administration interface that has a default user name and password. Unless that configuration is changed, an attacker will be able to access all of the critical logging information for your application.

Mitigations include:

- Configuration reviews
- Setting defaults to disable all access
- Automated configuration audits
- Requiring multiple layers of access for remote configuration

## A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components

📖 **Suggested reading**: [Snyk Learn vulnerable and outdate components](https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/vulnerable-and-outdated-components/javascript/)

The longer an application has been deployed, the more likely it is that the attack surface, and corresponding exploits, of the application will increase. This is primarily due to the cost of maintaining an application and keeping it up to date in order to mitigate newly discovered exploits.

Outdated components often accumulate as third party packages are used by the application. Over time the packages are updated in order to address security concerns, or somethings the packages stop being supported. When this happens your application becomes vulnerable. Consider what happens when a request to install NPM packages displays the following warning:

```sh
➜  npm install

up to date, audited 1421 packages in 3s

7 high severity vulnerabilities

To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.
```

The application developer is warned that the components are vulnerable, but when faced choice of taking the time to update packages, and potentially break the application, or meeting deliverable deadlines, the developer is tempted to ignore the warning and continue without addressing the possible problem.

Mitigations include:

- Keeping a manifest of your software stack including versions
- Reviewing security bulletins
- Regularly updating software
- Required components to be up to date
- Replacing unsupported software

## A07 Identification and Authentication Failures

Identification and authentication failures include any situation where a user's identity can be impersonated or assumed by an attacker. For example, if an attacker can repeatedly attempt to guess a user's password, then eventually they will be successful. Additionally, if passwords are exposed outside of the application, or are stored inside the application, with weak cryptographic protection, then they are susceptible to attack.

Another example of an identification failure would be a weak password recovery process that doesn't properly verify the user. Common practices such as asking for well known security questions (e.g. mother's maiden name) from a user fall into this category.

Mitigations include:

- Rate limiting requests
- Properly managing credentials
- Multifactor authentication
- Authentication recovery

## A08 Software and Data Integrity Failure

Software and data integrity failures represent attacks that allow external software, processes, or data to compromise your application. Modern web applications extensively use open source and commercially produced packages to provide key functionality. Using these packages without conducting a security audit, gives them an unknown amount of control over your application. Likewise, using a third party processing workflow, or blindly accessing external data, opens you up to attacks.

Consider the use of a third party continuous delivery (CD) pipeline for deploying your application to a cloud provider. If the CD provider is penetrated by an attacker then they also gain access to your production cloud environment.

Another example is the use of an NPM package that is controlled by an attacker. Once the package has gained general acceptance, the attacker can subtly change the package to capture and deliver sensitive information.

Mitigations include:

- Only using trusted package repositories
- Using your own private vetted repository
- Audit all updates to third party packages and data sources

## A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

📖 **Suggested reading**: [Snyk Learn logging vulnerabilities](https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/logging-vulnerabilities/javascript/)

Proper system monitoring, logging, and alerting is critical to increasing security. One of the first things an attacker will do after penetrating your application is delete or alter any logs that might reveal the attacker's presence. A secure system will store logs that are accessible, immutable, and contain adequate information to detect an intrusion, and conduct post-mortem analysis.

An attacker might also try to create a smoke screen in the monitoring system in order to hide a true attack. This might consist of a barrage of periodic ineffective attacks that hide the insertion of a slightly different effective one.

Mitigations include:

- Real time log processing
- Automated alerts for metric threshold violations
- Periodic log reviews
- Visual dashboards for key indicators

## A10 Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

📖 **Suggested reading**: [Snyk Learn SSRF](https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery/javascript/)

This category of attack causes the application service to make unintended internal requests, that utilized the service's elevated privileges, in order to expose internal data or services.

For example, if your service exposed an endpoint that let a user retrieve an external profile image based upon a supplied URL, an attacker could change the URL to point to a location that is normally only available to the service internally.

The following command would theoretically return the internal AWS service metadata that includes the administrative access token.

```sh
curl https://yourdomain.click/user/image?imgUrl=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/Admin-Role
```

Mitigations include:

- Sanitizing returned data
- Not returning data
- Whitelisting accessible domains
- Rejecting HTTP redirects
