# The Console

**Required reading**: [MDN - Command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line)

Also know as the command line, shell, or terminal, the console is an essential web development tool. The console provides access to the file system and allows for the execution of command line applications.

There are many console applications that you can chose from. All operating systems come with a default console, but you will probably want to install one in order to get the best experience. Here is an example of [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) running on a Mac.

## Make sure you have a console application

In order for you to successfully use the console for web programming it must be [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant. POSIX compliance means that it supports a standard set of console commands. Both Mac and Linix support POSIX. That means any necessary console commands will work on those operating systems. On Microsoft Windows, you can get a reasonable console application by installing [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Open your console application and make sure you can run a simple POSIX compliant command such as `pwd` (present working directory). If this displays the name directory you are currently working in then you are on the right track.

## Viewing the file system

One of the primary purposes of a console application is to view the files on the computer. The files on a computer are organized into a tree structure of nodes called directories. At any given point in time your console is located at one of the directories in the file system. You can see which directory you are in with the `pwd` (present working directory) command.

```bash
➜  pwd
/Users/student/byu/cs260/2023winter/source/webprogramming260
```

You can list all of the files in the directory with `ls` (list files). Most command line applications take parameters that are specified after you type the application name. For example, `ls` can list all files (even hidden ones) in a long format if you provide the parameter `-la`.

```bash
➜ ls -la
total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 lee  staff   1.0K Nov 19 08:47 LICENSE
-rw-r--r--  1 lee  staff    82B Nov 19 08:47 README.md
drwxr-xr-x  4 lee  staff   128B Nov 19 08:48 profile
drwxr-xr-x  4 lee  staff   128B Nov 19 08:47 react
```

## Executing commands

The other primary purpose of the console is to execute commands. You already did this in the previous section when you executed commands for working with the file system. However, console commands can perform any operation. Here are some basic commands that you show experiment with.

- **echo** - Output the parameters of the command
- **cd** - Change directory
- **mkdir** - Make directory
- **rmdir** - Remove directory
- **rm** - Remove file(s)
- **mv** - Move file(s)
- **cp** - Copy files
- **ls** - List files
- **curl** - Command line client URL browser
- **grep** - Regular expression search
- **find** - Find files
- **top** - View running processes with CPU and memory usage
- **df** - View disk statistics
- **cat** - Print out the contents of a file
- **less** - Same as cat but allows for scrolling in the file
- **wc** - Count the words in a file
- **ps** - View the currently running processes
- **kill** - Kill a currently running process
- **sudo** - Execute a command as a super user (admin)
- **ssh** - Create a secure shell on a remote computer
- **scp** - Securely copy files to a remote computer
- **history** - Show the history of commands
- **ping** - Check if a website is up
- **tracert** - Trace the connections to a website
- **dig** - Show the DNS information for a domain
- **man** - Look up a command in the manual

You can also chain the input and output of commands using special characters

- `|` - The the output from the command on the left and _pipe_ it to the command on the right
- `>` - Redirect output to a file. Appends if the file exists
- `>>` - Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists

For example, you can list the files in a directory, pipe it into `grep` to search for files created in Nov, and then pipe then into `wc` to count the number of files found with a date of Nov.

```
ls -l | grep ' Nov ' | wc -l
```

There are also keystokes that have special meaning in the console.

- `CTRL-R` - Use type ahead to find previous commands
- `CTRL-C` - Kill the currently running command

## ☑ Assignment

Experiment with console commands. Open a console window and create a junk directory that you can play with by executing the command `mkdir junk` (make directory). Then execute the command `cd junk` to move your present working directory into that directory. Try the following sequence of commands:

```
mkdir junk
cd junk
pwd
ls
ls -la
ls ../
echo "hello world" > test.txt
ls -l
cat test.txt
cp test.txt other.txt
ls
cat test.txt >> other.txt
less other.txt # press `q` to exit less
rm test.txt
ls
cd ..
ls
rm -rf junk
ls
```

The better you get at working within the console the more efficient your programming will be. When you are done experimenting, submit a description of something you found interesting to the Canvas assignment.
