One of your main objectives of this class is to improve your social skills. Working with peers is a great way to do that. You are encouraged to work on your start up project with another member as you practice what is know as pair programming. Pair programming gained popularity over twenty years ago and is commonly practiced in the industry.

It is important to understand that pair programming is not simply working together, and it is definitely **not** division of labour. It is not a time saving technique. All parties must be present for all work. Pair programming follows a very specific process where one member of the pair is the driver and the other is the navigator. The Navigator researches and outlines the overall design. The driver handles the keyboard and is in control the tactical implementation details. After a reasonable milestone is achieved, or time period (~30 minutes) is exceeded, the driver and navigator switch. It is also important to celebrate milestones together. Cookies work great as motivational rewards.

If done correctly the pairs will learn from each other and produce a much better result. If you want to try pair programming (and I highly encourage you to do) then introduce yourself to others in the class and see if they are interested. You can also use the `pair-programming` channel on Discord to reach out and find a partner.

Once you find a partner read the [MartinFolwer.com article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html) together so that you both have the same understanding and expectations.
