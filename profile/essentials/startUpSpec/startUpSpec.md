# Start up deliverable - specification

Your start up application demonstrates your mastery of the instruction presented by this course. Make sure you put significant effort into coming up with a simple yet interesting idea. Your application needs to demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, calling web services, providing web services, authentication, storing data persistently, using web sockets for peer to peer communication, and running as a progressive web application.

Create an elevator pitch for your application. Something that would excite an investment firm if you happen to catch a ride up the elevator with one of their representatives. Or maybe just sound cool to your friends if they are your target audience. This should be no more than a paragraph in length.

Then sketch out what the application looks like. You can use a tool like [NinjaMock.com](https://ninjamock.com/) to quickly produce a rough layout. Google docs, or plain old paper works fine too (just take pictures for your submission).

Here is an [example design](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md).

## Represent all technologies

Make sure that your specification represents how you will represent all of the class technologies. This includes the following:

- **Authentication**: An input for your user to create an account and login. You will want to display the user's name after they login.
- **Database data**: A rendering of application data that is stored in the database. For Simon, this is the high scores of all players.
- **WebSocket data**: A rendering of data that is received from your server. This maybe realtime data sent from other user's (e.g. chat or scoring data), or realtime data that your service is generating (e.g. stock prices or latest high scores). For Simon, this represents every time another user creates or ends a game.

## Using Markdown

Take some time to properly learn how to use Markdown in your README.md. Read the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for examples on how to use Markdown. Refer to the [example design](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) to see how to embed images. Make sure your images are in a format that browsers natively support such as JPG, GIF, or PNG.

## ☑ Assignment

Update the README.md file for your start up GitHub repository that you created in the earlier instruction to include your elevator pitch. Include the pitch paragraph, key features, and images.

Make sure you push your changes to the file so that it can be reviewed.

Submit the URL for your GitHub start up repository to the Canvas assignment.

## Grading Rubric

- 10% - Notes in your start up Git repository README.md that include your elevator pitch, images, and key features
- 10% - Proper use of Markdown in README.md.
- 40% - A concise, compelling, elevator pitch
- 40% - One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in your README.md.
