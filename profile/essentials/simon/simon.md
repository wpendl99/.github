# Let's play Simon

![Simon](simon.png)

In the 1978 Milton-Bradley release an electronic game named [Simon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)>). It was cutting edge at the time since there were so few electronic games, and all the cool kids had one. I did not. So now I get my revenge.

We are going to build a peer to peer multiplayer web application modeled after Simon. We will build it together by adding new functionality every time we learn a new technology. The example version of code and production deployment for each iteration will be available to you. Your job will be to review the example and then build your version. If it looks very much like the example that is fine. Just make sure you are learning how it works. The less you copy/paste, and the more you write it yourself, the more you will learn. This is true, even if you are just looking at the example and typing most of what you see. The goal is to make you think about every line of code. Ask, "why is it done this way?" and "Is there a better way?". You will be surprised with the detailed understanding you will get. If your version looks very different than the example that the is great. Just make sure the major technology is represented.

You can play the example production release [here](https://simon.cs260.click).

The different technologies we are going to demonstrate with our Simon iterations.
