# Acknowledgements

The instruction makes extensive use of [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) and we highly encourage you to spend many hours getting lost in their exceptional content.

[React](https://reactjs.org) is used to demonstrate the power of web frameworks. Without the significant contributions of the React community we would not be able to stand on the shoulders of giants.

Much appreciation goes to [CodePen](https://codepen.io) for hosting many of the exercises and instruction examples.

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) made it possible to experiment with DNS, create web servers, and host the project content

The demonstration application `Simon` is based on the game by Milton-Bradley. Simon is a registered trademark of Hasbro. Our use of the name and the game is for non-profit educational use only. No part of the Simon code should be used outside of that definition.
