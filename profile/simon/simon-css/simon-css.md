# Simon CSS

![Simon](../simon.png)

This application deliverable demonstrates the use of basic CSS for styling and a responsive design.

The addition of CSS makes our application visually appealing and adds intuitive user interface elements, but it is still not functional due to the lack of interactivity. We will add that in the next deliverable when we introduce JavaScript.

This deliverable adds a single CSS file (`main.css`) that contains the CSS for the entire application. Each of the HTML files references the CSS file using the `link` element.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />
```

As the application gets more complicated we will break up the CSS into individual files that correspond to the component they style.

You can view this application running here: [Example Simon CSS](https://simon-css.cs260.click)

## Study this code

Get familiar with what the example code teaches.

- Clone the repository to your development environment.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-css.git
  ```

- Review the code and get comfortable with everything it represents.
- View the code in your browser by hosting it using the VS Code Live Server extension.
- Make modifications to the code as desired. Experiment and see what happens.

## Deploy to production

- Deploy to your production environment using the `deployFiles.sh` script found in the [example class application](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-css/blob/main/deployFiles.sh). Take some time to understand how it works. This is the same script that you used for the Simon HTML version.

  ```sh
  ./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s simon
  ```

  For example,

  ```sh
  ./deployFiles.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s simon
  ```

- Update your `start up` repository README.md to record and reflect on what you learned.
- Make sure your project is visible from your production environment (e.g. https://simon.yourdomain.click).
- Submit the URL to your production environment for grading using the Canvas assignment page.

## Grading Rubric

- 50% - Simon CSS deployed to your production environment
- 50% - Notes in your `start up` repository README.md about what you have learned
