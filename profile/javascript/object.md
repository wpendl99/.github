# JavaScript object

**Suggested reading**: [MDN Classes in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript)

A JavaScript object represents a collection of name value pairs referred to as properties. Then property name must be of type String or Symbol, but the value can be of any type. Objects also have common object-oriented functionality such as constructors, a this pointer, static properties and functions, and inheritance.

Objects can be created by calling the constructor on the Object class using the new operator. Once declared you can add properties to the object by simply referencing the new property name in an assignment. Any type of variable can be assigned to a property. This includes a sub object, array, or function. The properties of an object can be referenced either with dot (`obj.prop`) or bracket notation (`obj['prop']`).

```js
const obj = new Object();

obj.c = [1, 2, 3];
obj.hello = function () {
  console.log('hello');
};

console.log(obj);
// OUTPUT: {a: 3, b: 'fish', c: [1,2,3], hello: func}
```

The ability to dynamically modify an object is incredibly useful when manipulating data with an indeterminate structure.

⚠ Note the different uses of the term `object`. Object can refer to a class of variable types (Object, Function, Date, ...), or it can refer to the actual Object type (i.e. new Object()), or it can refer to an actual variable of type Object. This overloaded usage can be a bit confusing.

## Object-literals

You can also declare a variable of object type with the `object-literal` syntax. This syntax allows you to provide the initial composition of the object.

```js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};
```

## Object functions

The Object class has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the interesting ones.

| Function | Meaning                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| entries  | Returns an array of key value pairs |
| keys     | Returns an array of keys            |
| values   | Returns an array of values          |

```js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
// OUTPUT: [['a', 3], ['b', 'fish']]
console.log(Object.keys(obj));
// OUTPUT: ['a', 'b']
console.log(Object.values(obj));
// OUTPUT: [3, 'fish']
```

## Constructor

Any function that returns an object is considered a `constructor` and can be invoked with the `new` operator.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {name: 'Eich'}
```

Because objects can have any type of property value you can create methods on the object as part of its encapsulation.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

## This pointer

Notice in the last example the use of the keyword `this` when we referred to the name property (`this.name`). The meaning of `this` depends upon the scope of where it is used, but in the context of an object it refers to a pointer to the object. We will talk more about the `this` pointer in the instruction on scope.

## Classes

You can use classes to define objects. Using a class clarify the intent to create a reusable component rather than a one off object. Class declarations looks similar to declaring an object, but with an explicit constructor and assumed properties and function definitions. Our person object from above would look like the following when converted to a class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

You can make properties of functions private by prefixing them with a `#`.

```js
class Person {
  #name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.#name = 'Lie';
// OUTPUT: Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

## Inheritance

Classes can be extended by using th `extends` keyword to define inheritance. Parameters that need to be passed to the parent class are delivered using the `super` function. Any functions defined on the child that have the same name as the parent override the parents implementation. The parent's functions can be explicitly accessed using the `super` keyword.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  print() {
    return 'My name is ' + this.name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, position) {
    super(name);
    this.position = position;
  }

  print() {
    return super.print() + '. I am a ' + this.position;
  }
}

const e = new Employee('Eich', 'programmer');
console.log(e.print());
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich. I am a programmer
```

## ☑ Assignment

Create a CodePen that uses objects and classes.

When you are done submit your CodePen URL, along with a description of something your found interesting, to the Canvas assignment.
