# Debugging JavaScript

It is inevitable that your code is going to have problems, or bugs, at some point. That may be while you are originally authoring it, working on other code that changes assumed dependencies, or while enhancing the code with future functionality. Learning how to quickly discover, and resolve, bugs will greatly increase your enhance your value as a web developer. Additionally, debugging skills can also be used during the development process. By following a pattern of writing a block of code and then stepping through, or debugging, the block gives you confidence that the block is working as desired before moving onto the next block.

## Console debugging

📖 **Suggested reading**: [MDN Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console)

One of the simplest ways to debug your JavaScript code is to insert `console.log` functions that output the state of the code as it executes. For example, we can create a simple web application that has a HTML and JavaScript file that demonstrates the difference between `let` and `var`. By inserting `console.log` statements into the code we can see what the value of each variable is as the code executes.

**HTML**

```html
<body>
  <h1>Debugging</h1>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
```

**JavaScript**

```js
var varCount = 20;
let letCount = 20;

console.log("Initial - var: %d, let: %d", varCount, letCount);

for (var varCount = 1; varCount < 2; varCount++) {
  for (let letCount = 1; letCount < 2; letCount++) {
    console.log("Loop - var: %d, let: %d", varCount, letCount);
  }
}

const h1El = document.querySelector("h1");
h1El.textContent = `Result - var:${varCount}, let:${letCount}`;
console.log("Final - var: %d, let: %d", varCount, letCount);
```

If we open these files into a directory, open that directory in VS Code, run it using the VS Code live server extension, open the Chrome browser debugger (press `F12`), select the `Console` tab, and then refresh the browser, you will see the following result.

You can also use the debugger console window to inspect variables without using the console.log function from your code. For example, if you type varCount in the console window it will print out the current value of varCount. You can also execute JavaScript directly in the console window. For example, if you type `varCount = 50` and press `Enter` it will change the current value of varCount.

## Browser debugging

Console.log debugging is great for times when you just need to quickly see what is going on in your code, but to really understand the code as it executes you want to use the full capabilities of the browser's debugger.

Using the same setup we used for console.log debugging open up Chrome's browser debugger, but this time select the source tab. This will display the source files that comprise the currently rendered content.

You can either select `index.js` from the source view on the left, or press `CTRL-P` (on Windows) or `CMD-P` (on Mac) and then select `index.js` from the list that pops up. Then set a breakpoint on line 4 by clicking on the line number on the left of the displayed source code. This makes it so that the execution of code will pause whenever that line is executed. Refreshing the browser window will cause `index.js` to reload and pause on the breakpoint.

With the browser paused in the debugger you can move your mouse cursor over a variable to see its value, see what variables are in scope, set watches on variables, or use the console to interact with the code.

This gives you complete control to inspect what you JavaScript code is doing and experiment with possible alternative directions with the code. Take some time to poke around in the debugger. Learning how to exploit its functional will make you a much better web developer.
